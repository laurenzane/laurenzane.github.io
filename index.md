## Bio
Hi, neighbor! My name is Lauren and I'm currently a first-year PhD student 
at the University of Rhode Island, advised by Dr. Hollie Putnam. Broadly, I am interested in using stable
isotope analysis to understand coral nutritional flexibility under multiple
bleaching scenarios in the field (beautiful Mo'orea, French Polynesia). 
I hope to couple SIA with metabolomics and proteomics to
test hypotheses related to the availbility of epigenetic modifiers and 
cofactors and connect them to resulting epigenetic marks. In particular
I'm also interested in the relationship and interplay of long noncoding RNAs and gene body
methylation.
