## Bio
Hi, neighbor! My name is Lauren and I'm currently a first-year PhD student 
at the University of Rhode Island. Broadly, I am interested in using stable
isotope analysis to understand coral nutritional flexibility under multiple
bleaching scenarios in the field (beautiful Mo'orea, French Polynesia). 
I hope to couple SIA with metabolomics and proteomics to
test hypotheses related to the availbility of epigenetic modifiers and 
cofactors and connect them to the resulting epigenetic mark. In particular
I'm also interested in the relationship of long noncoding RNAs, gene body
methylation, and related enzymes.
